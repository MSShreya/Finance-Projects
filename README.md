# Finance Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my **Finance Projects Portfolio**, a curated collection of practical projects designed to demonstrate my expertise and hands-on skills in key areas essential for a Financial Analyst role.

## Vision

My goal with this portfolio is to showcase real-world applications of financial concepts through detailed projects involving:

- **Financial Modeling** — building dynamic and robust models for budgeting, forecasting, and scenario analysis  
- **Data Analysis & Visualization** — extracting insights and creating interactive dashboards using Excel and Power BI  
- **Valuation Techniques** — applying industry-standard valuation methods such as DCF and Comparable Company Analysis  
- **Business Intelligence Tools** — designing visual reports to support strategic decision-making  
- **Budgeting & Expense Tracking** — managing financial data to monitor and control spending  
- **Process Optimization** — improving workflows and financial processes for better efficiency  
- **Scenario & Sensitivity Analysis** — assessing financial impacts under varying assumptions  
- **Reporting & Documentation** — preparing clear and concise financial reports with supporting visuals

Each project is structured to reflect a comprehensive approach — from problem statement and methodology to analysis and conclusions — highlighting not just technical skills but also my ability to interpret and communicate financial information effectively.
